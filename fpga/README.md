# DSP/SDR with FPGA

**A board for DSP/SDR with FPGA by Daniel Uppstr√∂m, SM6VFZ**

A four-layer PCB was first designed by mid 2013 to carry a 24 bit ADC,
a high-speed DAC, a Cyclone II FPGA and a 16 bit audio codec.  In 2014
and 2015 it was further developed, together with RF and control
boards, towards forming a complete shortwave and 144 MHz all-mode
transceiver.
In 2016 a new version of the FPGA-board, with a Cyclone IV, was developed together with Elektor Labs. This board is the current platform used in the project.

## Communication protocol

Communication with the FPGA board is over I2C or UART.
